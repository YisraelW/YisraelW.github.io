<h1>(For Dog Owners) How to Make a Bed</h1>
<ol>
   <li>Chase the dog off the bed.</li>
   <li>Throw the buried bone into the dog's bed.</li>
   <li>Pick up one of the pillows to start stacking the pillow nicely.</li>
   <li>Extract the pillow from the dog's teeth.</li>
   <li>Sternly reprimand the dog.</li>
   <li>Either repair the ripped pillow or replace the pillow.</li>
   <li>Quickly arrange the pillows, sheets and blankets.</li>
   <li> Throw on a bedspread as best as you can while ignoring the whining dog at your feet.</li>
   <li>Repeat from the first step as needed.</li>
 </ol> 
<p>Keep in mind the words of Groucho Marx: Outside of a dog, a book is Man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read.</p>
