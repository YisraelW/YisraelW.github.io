<h1>(For Dog Owners) How to Make a Bed</h1>
<p>Want to make the bed and you have a dog? Just follow these easy steps each morning. </p>
<ol>
   <li>Chase the dog off the bed.</li>
   <li>Find the bone buried inside the quilt and throw it onto the dog's bed.</li>
   <li>Pick up a pillow to start stacking the pillows nicely.</li>
   <li>Extract the pillow from the dog's teeth.</li>
   <li>Sternly reprimand the dog.</li>
   <li>Either repair or replace the ripped pillow.</li>
   <li>Quickly arrange the pillows, sheets, and blankets.</li>
   <li>Throw on a bedspread as best as you can while ignoring the whining dog at your feet.</li>
   <li>Repeat from the first step as needed.</li>
 </ol> 
<p>Keep in mind the words of Groucho Marx: Outside of a dog, a book is Man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read.</p>
